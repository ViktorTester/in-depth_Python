"""The 'retry' decorator takes one argument:

times â€” natural number

The decorator retries the function it is decorating if an error occurs
during its execution. The decorator calls this until it runs out of times,
at which point it throws a MaxRetriesException.

The decorator also stores the name and docstring of the function being decorated."""
