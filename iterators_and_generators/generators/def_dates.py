"""The dates() generator function takes two arguments in the following order:

start â€” date, date type
count - natural number, default value is None

If 'count' is None, the function returns a generator that generates a sequence
of the maximum number of dates allowed (type date), starting with the 'start' date.

If 'count' has a natural number as its value, the function returns a generator
that generates a sequence of 'count' dates (of type date), starting with the
'start' date, and then raises a StopIteration exception."""
